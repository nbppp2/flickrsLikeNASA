# FlickrsLikeNASA

I pretty much hate infinite scroll. Not because of the concept, but because the implementation never seems to be quite there. I was asked to write a site that reads a NASA Flickr feed, and I figured this was going to be the best time to reinvent the wheel.

My plan is to implement the infinite scroll component using this feed and it's pages as an example. I will eventually pack the infinite scroll as a WebComponent so that you can use it in any modern application.

## Tools used

I decided to use Angular to develop this site, and am using Angular 6. I did this because I feel I need more Angular practice, since I'm currently working on jQuery & AngularJS apps.

I decided to use Bourbon & Neat for layout, as I've used Bootstrap in the past and felt like this would be an opportunity to learn that as well.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running
run `ng serve`. This will build and serve the project on port 4200. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:4200`

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
